        Alice and Bob play a game. They have a blackboard; initially, there are n
        integers written on it,and each integer is equal to 1<br/>
        Alice and Bob take turns; Alice goes first. On their turn, the player has to choose several (at least two) equal integers on the board, wipe<br/> them and write a new integer which is equal to their sum.
        For example, if the board currently contains integers <b>{1,1,2,2,2,3},</b><br/>then the following moves are possible:
        <ul>
          <li>choose two integers equal to 1 wipe them and write an integer 2 then the board becomes <b>{2,2,2,2,3}</b></li>
          <li>choose two integers equal to 2, wipe them and write an integer 4,then the board becomes <b>{1,1,2,3,4}</b></li>
          <li>choose three integers equal to 2, wipe them and write an integer 6 , then the board becomes <b>{1,1,3,6}</b></li>
        </ul>
        If a player cannot make a move (all integers on the board are different), that player wins the game.
        <br/><br/>Determine who wins if both players play optimally.
        <h4>Input</h4>
        <p class="function">The first line contains one integer t
            (1≤t≤99
            ) — the number of test cases.<br/>
           
           Each test case consists of one line containing one integer n
            (2≤n≤100
           ) — the number of integers equal to 1
            on the board.
        </p>
        <h4>Output</h4>
        <p class="function">
            For each test case, print Alice if Alice wins when both players play optimally. Otherwise, print Bob.

      <h4>&nbsp;Note</h4>
      <p>In the first test case, n=3
        , so the board initially contains integers {1,1,1}
        . We can show that Bob can always win as follows: there are two possible first moves for Alice.
        <ul>
            <li>if Alice chooses two integers equal to 1
                , wipes them and writes 2
                , the board becomes {1,2}
                . Bob cannot make a move, so he wins;</li>
            <li>if Alice chooses three integers equal to 1
                , wipes them and writes 3
                , the board becomes {3}
                . Bob cannot make a move, so he wins.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the second test case, n=6
        , so the board initially contains integers {1,1,1,1,1,1}
        . Alice can win by, for example, choosing two integers equal to 1
        , wiping them and writing 2
        on the first turn. Then the board becomes {1,1,1,1,2}
        , and there are three possible responses for Bob:
      <ul>
        <li>if Bob chooses four integers equal to 1
            , wipes them and writes 4
            , the board becomes {2,4}
            . Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;</li>
        <li>if Bob chooses three integers equal to 1
            , wipes them and writes 3
            , the board becomes {1,2,3}
            . Alice cannot make a move, so she wins;</li>
        <li>if Bob chooses two integers equal to 1
            , wipes them and writes 2
            , the board becomes {1,1,2,2}
            . Alice can continue by, for example, choosing two integers equal to 2
            , wiping them and writing 4
            . Then the board becomes {1,1,4}
            . The only possible response for Bob is to choose two integers equal to 1
             and write 2
             instead of them; then the board becomes {2,4}
            , Alice cannot make a move, so she wins.</li>
      </ul>
